<div class=post_title>How entries are added to this blog</div>
<div class=post_summary>The system for adding entries to the blog is explained, and hints are given for debugging the formatting.</div>
<p>Entries are added to this blog simpy by creating files in the <code>_posts/</code> directory. There is an important convention on the file names: they must start with the year, followed by a dash, followed by the decimal number (with leading zero if appropriate), followed by the day, followed by a dash and then followed by some title words, and with <code>.md</code> at the end.</p>

<p>The format of the blog entries is markdown for the main body, but the first part must be a preface in so-called YAML format. See any existing blog entry for the format, which should be simple to understand.</p>

<p>Since Markdown errors will cause non-display of the item when it is eventually uploaded to github, it is important to test things locally first. This is very easy. In the commandline, type</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>jekyll serve --watch
</code></pre></div>
<p>to start a server. It will state a local URL that holds the blog. Cut and past that URL in a browser, and you will see a local copy of the blog. Every time you edit a file, <code>jekyll</code> will update the blog, but you will need to do a browser refresh to see the results.</p>

<p>Once things work well locally, type the following in a terminal to upload the blog to github.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>make
git add .
git commit -m MSG
git push
</code></pre></div>
<p>PS. the <code>make</code> part of the above is important, because it moves a tags file from a location where github will not find it, to another where it will be found. Simply using <code>git</code> to upload files will give a blog that works in all respects except for tagging, but what would be the point of that?</p>
