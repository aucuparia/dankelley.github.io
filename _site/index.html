    <li> Dan has a blog at <a href="http://saltydrip.wordpress.com">WordPress</a>,
    and is also experimenting with github blogging as indicated below.  (Readers
    interested in github blogging might find the <a
        href="https://github.com/dankelley/dankelley.github.io">source code</a> for
    the blog of some use, but should be warned that it is still rough around the edges,
    and that it may go away if it proves bothersome to use, compared with wordpress.)
