<h1>About Dan Kelley</h1>

<p>Dan is a Professor of Oceanography at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova
Scotia, Canada.  He teaches there, and is also the Graduate Coordinator.  His research focuses on ocean mixing, especially that caused by internal waves and double-diffusive convection.</p>

<p> An official website at <a
    href="http://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/oceanography/faculty-staff/faculty/daniel-e-kelley.html">Dalhousie
    University</a> provides contact information and (by university mandate)
mentions just five publications.  This is a sensible starting point for
potential Honours, MSc or PhD students who would like to work with Dan.</p>

<p>Since potential students and colleagues will probably want to see his
publications, Dan has subscribed to both ResearchGate and GoogleScholar.  The
<a
    href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dan_Kelley3/contributions/?ev=prf_act">
    ResearchGate website</a> provides free PDFs of publications, along with
citation counts that are so inaccurate that one wonders why they bother trying.
By contrast, the <a
    href="http://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=6ujnSaEAAAAJ&hl=en">Google-scholar
    website</a> provides citation counts that seem more reasonable, but only
publisher links to the papers, which means that readers will need to be at an
institution that subscribes to the journals in which he has published.</p>


<p>Dan is the author of the Oce package for oceanographic analysis in R,
and readers can follow its development, along with other things he makes
public, by viewing his <a
    href="https://github.com/dankelley?tab=repositories">Github
    repositories</a>.</p>

<p>In late 2013, Dan started experimenting with blogging, creating a <a
    href="http://saltydrip.wordpress.com">WordPress</a> blog.  Finding the
WordPress data entry scheme to be somewhat arduous, and disliking the
lock-in to a commercial site, he migrated his posts to a <a
    href="/blog">GitHub blog</a> in early 2014, and that is where he has
blogged since.</p>
