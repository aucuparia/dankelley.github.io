    <p>Dan is a Professor of Oceanography at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova
Scotia, Canada.  He teaches there, and is also the Graduate Coordinator.  His
research focus is on ocean mixing caused by internal waves and double-diffusive
convection.</p>

<p> An official website at <a
    href="http://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/oceanography/faculty-staff/faculty/daniel-e-kelley.html">Dalhousie
    University</a> provides contact information and (by university mandate)
mentions just five publications.  Colleagues or potential Honours, MSc or PhD
students may wish to consult <a href="/publications.html">Publications tab</a>
    to get a full publication list, including PDF links.  The <a
        href="/software.html">Software tab</a> may be of interest to those who
    are interested in Dan's contributions to Oceanographic software.  Dan's <a
    href="/blog">Blog tab</a> provides some thoughts on Oceanographic analysis
in R (the topic of his upcoming textbook).</p>
