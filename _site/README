Github page

Late January 2014: trying out blogging on github.  Still need to figure out how
to permit tags, which are built automatically when jekyll is run locally, but
which are not working in github.  With the need to separately create figures,
I'm not sure this is a real advantage over wordpress except for the tighter
control over content.
