Github page

Late January 2014: trying out blogging on github. There are pros and cons to this, and I intend to decide by mid February 2014 whether to continue blogging on github.

* **Pros:** 

- All sources are local and can be redeployed locally or anywhere else.  This means there is no reliance on a commercial enterprise, which might go bankrupt or might start flooding readers with adverts.

- A normal text editor can be used for writing, which reduces greatly the pain of writing (and especially editing).

* **Cons:** 

- Markdown errors are handled poorly, resulting in blank pages, and so using this system requires some care.

- Wordpress users have no easy way to follow such a blog.
