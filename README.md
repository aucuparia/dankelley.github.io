This Jekyll-based blog was started January 2014, at which time a few items
previously stored on wordpress were transferred here.  The advantage of
blogging with Jekyll is mainly that the files are local and can be created in a
standard text editor.  The disadvantage is that anything not in the wordpress
system is a bit hidden from the blogging community.
