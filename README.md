Github page

Late January 2014: trying out blogging on github.  Pros: all soruces are local, so no worries if wordpress goes out of business (or floods us with adverts).  Cons: markdown errors are handled poorly, wordpress users have no easy way to follow.

*Plans* convert the following from wordpress (delete when done):

- FROM JAN 2014: 'smoothing hydrographic profiles' 'inferring halocline depth' 'PISA scores'

- FROM DEC 2013: 'installing oce', 'r interface to webtide' 'webtide' 'sundial' 'analemma' 'coastlinein in oce package' 'day length'
