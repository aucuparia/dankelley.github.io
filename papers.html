<p>Since potential students and colleagues will probably want to see his
publications, Dan has subscribed to both ResearchGate and GoogleScholar.  The
<a
    href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dan_Kelley3/contributions/?ev=prf_act">
    ResearchGate website</a> provides free PDFs of publications, along with
citation counts that are so inaccurate that one wonders why they bother trying.
By contrast, the <a
    href="http://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=6ujnSaEAAAAJ&hl=en">Google-scholar
    website</a> provides citation counts that seem more reasonable, but only
publisher links to the papers, which means that readers will need to be at an
institution that subscribes to the journals in which he has published.</p>
