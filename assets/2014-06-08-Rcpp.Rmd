summary: A test of using C++ to speed up R
description: Using which(...)[1] seems wasteful because work is done even after the desired result is found. A C++ approach is demonstrated here, and tested for speed.

# Introduction

Quite often I write ``which(...)[1]`` to find the first element of a vector matching some condition.  One has to wonder whether that's wasteful, though, since there is no need to do any tests once one works.  I decided to try using C++, using Rcpp, to see if speed advances could be made.

# Procedure

```{r}
library(Rcpp)
library(microbenchmark)
cppFunction('
            int firstZero(IntegerVector x) {
                int nx = x.size();
                for (int i = 0; i < nx; ++i) {
                    if (0 == x[i]) {
                        return i+1;
                    }
                }
                return 0; // means none found
            }'
            )
x <- rep(1, 10000)
x[seq.int(500, 10000)] <- 0
microbenchmark(firstZero(x), times=1000L)
microbenchmark(which(0==x)[1], times=1000L)
```

# Results

The C++ method was nearly twice as fast.  However, other tests (with different
vector lengths, different fractions zeroed-out, etc) showed nearly identical
times for the two methods.

# Conclusions

Pending more tests (especially those tailored to data properties in actual
applications) would be helpful in making decisions about whether the added code
complexity of the Rcpp approach is a cost that should be paid.
