# Introduction

The default ``swN2()`` calculation in Oce uses a smoothing spline.  One disadvantage of this is that few readers will know how it works.  A possible alternative is to compute d(rho)/dz using the slope inferred from a running-window linear regression.  Such a slope is provided by the new Oce function ``runderiv()``, which is tested here.  (Note that ``runderiv()`` is new enough that its argument list may change as a result of tests like the present one.)

# Methods

```{r chunkName, fig.path='2014-02-10-'}
```

```{r}
library(oce)
data(ctd)
plot(ctd, which="N2")

## Using ``runderiv()`` to get d(rho)/dz
rho <- swRho(ctd)
z <- swZ(ctd)

drhodz <- runderiv(z, rho)
N2 <- -9.8 * drhodz / mean(rho, na.rm=TRUE)
lines(N2, -z, col='blue')
legend("bottomright", lwd=2, 
       col=c("brown", "blue"), legend=c("spline", "runderiv"),
       bg="white")
```

# Results

The reuults look similar *but* see the question below.


# Conclusions

Quantitative measures could be calculated of course, but this first test suggests that the benefits of ``smooth.spline()`` may be had with ``runderiv()``.

**Caution.** ``runderiv()`` is still so young that its argument list and action are likely to change at any time.  For example, as I was writing this posting I changes the order of the last two arguments, I made the default ``window="hanning"``, and I changed the auto-selection of ``L``; these changes seemed more sensible for application to things like N2.

# Questions

The graph shows evidence of an offset, in which the bottoms of the wiggles match better than the top.  Is that something wrong with the ``runderiv()`` code, or just a result of wiggles added to a gradient?
