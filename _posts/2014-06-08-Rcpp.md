summary: A test of using C++ to speed up R
description: Using which(...)[1] seems wasteful because work is done even after the desired result is found. A C++ approach is demonstrated here, and tested for speed.

# Introduction

Quite often I write ``which(...)[1]`` to find the first element of a vector matching some condition.  One has to wonder whether that's wasteful, though, since there is no need to do any tests once one works.  I decided to try using C++, using Rcpp, to see if speed advances could be made.

# Procedure


{% highlight r linenos=table %}
library(Rcpp)
library(microbenchmark)
cppFunction("\n            int firstZero(IntegerVector x) {\n                int nx = x.size();\n                for (int i = 0; i < nx; ++i) {\n                    if (0 == x[i]) {\n                        return i+1;\n                    }\n                }\n                return 0; // means none found\n            }")
x <- rep(1, 10000)
x[seq.int(500, 10000)] <- 0
microbenchmark(firstZero(x), times = 1000L)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Unit: microseconds
##          expr   min   lq median    uq   max neval
##  firstZero(x) 17.16 18.2   19.1 20.06 820.1  1000
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r linenos=table %}
microbenchmark(which(0 == x)[1], times = 1000L)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Unit: microseconds
##              expr   min    lq median    uq   max neval
##  which(0 == x)[1] 31.31 32.94  33.84 35.48 777.3  1000
{% endhighlight %}


# Results

The C++ method was nearly twice as fast.  However, other tests (with different
vector lengths, different fractions zeroed-out, etc) showed nearly identical
times for the two methods.

# Conclusions

Pending more tests (especially those tailored to data properties in actual
applications) would be helpful in making decisions about whether the added code
complexity of the Rcpp approach is a cost that should be paid.
