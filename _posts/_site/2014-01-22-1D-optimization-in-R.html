<p><em>Abstract.</em> The method of one-dimensional optimization is explained in the context of capillary waves.</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction.</strong></p>

<p>R provides functions for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional optimization. The second topic is much more complicated than the former (see e.g. Nocedal 1999) and will be left for another day.</p>

<p>A convenient function for 1D optimization is <code>optimize()</code>, also known as <code>optimise()</code>. Its first argument is a function whose minimum (or maximum) is sought, and the second is a two-element vector giving the range of values of the independent variable to be searched. (See <code>?optimize</code> for more.)</p>

<p><strong>2. Application.</strong></p>

<p>As an example, consider the phase speed of deep gravity-capillary waves, which is given by $\omega/k$ where $\omega$ is the frequency and $k$ is the wavenumber, and the two are bound together with the dispersion relationship $\omega^2=gk+\sigma k^3/\rho$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\sigma$ is the surface tension parameter (0.074 N/m for an air-water interface) and $\rho$ is the water density (1000 kg/m^3 for fresh water). This yields wave speed given by the following R function.</p>

<pre class="r"><code class="r">
phaseSpeed &lt;- function(k) {
    g &lt;- 9.8
    sigma &lt;- 0.074  # water-air
    rho &lt;- 1000  # fresh water
    omega2 &lt;- g * k + sigma * k^3/rho
    sqrt(omega2)/k
}
</code></pre>

<p>Readers with a background in the topic of waves may know that there is a minimum phase speed at wavelengths of about 2 cm, or a $k$ of approximately $2\pi/0.02$ which is about 300. It always makes sense to plot a function to be optimized, if only to check that it has been coded correctly, so thatâ€™s the next step.</p>

<pre class="r"><code class="r">
k &lt;- seq(100, 1000, length.out = 100)
par(mar = c(3, 3, 1, 1), mgp = c(2, 0.7, 0))
plot(k, phaseSpeed(k), type = &quot;l&quot;, xlab = &quot;Wavenumber&quot;, ylab = &quot;Phase speed&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-2.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" /></p>

<p>The results suggest that the range of $k$ illustrate contains the minimum, so we provide that to <code>optimize()</code>.</p>

<pre class="r"><code class="r">
o &lt;- optimize(phaseSpeed, range(k))
phaseSpeed(o$minimum)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
## [1] 0.2321
</code></pre>

<p>This speed is not especially fast; it would take about a heartbeat to move past your hand.</p>
