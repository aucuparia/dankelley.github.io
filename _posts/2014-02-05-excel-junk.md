Someone sent me some data in CSV format, created by excel.  The snapshot shows the time column that excel spat out to CSV.  The beginning suggests a format day/month/(year-2000) but nearer the end we can see that the format must be month/day/(year-2000) ... but it cannot be both, except I guess in excel-land.  This mixup happens at the end of every month, so I doubt that it resulted from human data entry.
