Someone sent me some data in CSV format, created by excel.  The snapshot shows the time column.  A glance at the first couple of entries made me think the format was The day/month/(year-2000) but pretty soon there was a row suggesting month/day/(year-2000).  This mixup happens at the end of every month, so I doubt that it resulted from human data entry.  But even if it were an issue with data entry, one would imagine a program as popular as excel would notice the problem and warn the user.
