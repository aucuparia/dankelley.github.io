# Introduction

The default ``swN2()`` calculation in Oce uses a smoothing spline.  One disadvantage of this is that few readers will know how it works.  A possible alternative is to compute d(rho)/dz using the slope inferred from a running-window linear regression.  Such a slope is provided by the new Oce function ``runlm()``, which is tested here.  (Note that ``runlm()`` is new enough that its argument list may change as a result of tests like the present one.)

# Methods


{% highlight r linenos=table %}
library(oce)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Loading required package: methods
## Loading required package: mapproj
## Loading required package: maps
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r linenos=table %}
data(ctd)
plot(ctd, which = "N2")

## Using ``runlm()`` to get d(rho)/dz
rho <- swRho(ctd)
z <- swZ(ctd)

drhodz <- runlm(z, rho, deriv = 1)
g <- 9.81
rho0 <- mean(rho, na.rm = TRUE)
N2 <- -g * drhodz/rho0
lines(N2, -z, col = "blue")
legend("bottomright", lwd = 2, col = c("brown", "blue"), legend = c("spline", 
    "runlm"), bg = "white")

# Results

The reuults look similar *but* see the question below.


# Conclusions

Quantitative measures could be calculated of course, but this first test suggests that the benefits of ``smooth.spline()`` may be had with ``runlm()``.

**Caution.** ``runlm()`` is still so young that its argument list and action are likely to change at any time.  For example, as I was writing this posting I changes the order of the last two arguments, I made the default ``window="hanning"``, and I changed the auto-selection of ``L``; these changes seemed more sensible for application to things like N2.

# What lengthscale to use?

It may be helpful to determine just how well the two methods can match.


{% highlight r linenos=table %}
N2 <- swN2(ctd)
N2fromderiv <- function(L) {
    -g * runlm(z, rho, L = L, deriv = 1)/rho0
}
best <- optimize(function(L) sqrt(mean((N2 - N2fromderiv(L))^2)), interval = c(1, 
    100))
print(best)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## $minimum
## [1] 6.161
## 
## $objective
## [1] 7.854e-05
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r linenos=table %}
N2best <- N2fromderiv(best$minimum)
{% endhighlight %}

This best-matching estimate is the red line.

{% highlight r linenos=table %}
plotProfile(ctd, "N2")
lines(N2best, ctd[["pressure"]], col = "red")
{% endhighlight %}

# Questions

1. Why is there a systematic offset in the last figure?
