# Introduction 

An interesting paper (Smith and Wessel, 1990) points out a weakness in using splines in cases with data gaps.  Their illustration of the problem with isobaths was particularly compelling.  I cannot reproduce their Fig 1b here, owing to copyright problems, but I digitized the data so I could test two R functions for splines.  Readers can follow along with the code given in this post.

# Methods

The first step is to load the data.  (Ignore the extra digits, which simply result from naive copying of digitized values.  I suppose the error is of order 2 percent or so, given the scanning of the diagram and my ability to position the pointer on my computer screen.)

{% highlight r %} 
distance <- c(23.17400, 25.09559, 31.15092, 40.75568,
              46.42938, 124.68628, 132.20556, 136.81277,
              141.37564, 145.08263, 149.38977)
topography <- c(-98.99976, -97.44730, -100.15198, -98.66016,
                -98.66016, -193.94266, -296.89045, -392.63991,
                -493.85330, -591.21586, -692.82951)
{% endhighlight %}

Next, plot the data.
{% highlight r %} 
if (!interactive()) png("splines.png", width=7, height=4, unit="in", res=150, pointsize=8)
par(mar=c(3, 3, 1, 1), mgp=c(2, 0.7, 0))
plot(distance, topography, ylim=c(-700, 0), pch=16)
grid()
{% endhighlight %}

Now, set up a gird, and show the results of ``smooth.spline()``.
{% highlight r %} 
d <- seq(min(distance), max(distance), length.out=100)
s <- smooth.spline(topography ~ distance)
ps <- predict(s, d)
lines(ps$x, ps$y)
{% endhighlight %}

Now, load the Akima package to get ``aspline()``, which presumably stems from Akima (1970).
{% highlight r %} 
library(akima)
akima <- aspline(distance, topography, d)
lines(akima$x, akima$y, col='red')
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, draw a legend and finish up.
{% highlight r %} 
legend("bottomleft", lwd=par('lwd'), bg='white',
       col=c("black", "red"),
       legend=c("smooth.spline", "aspline"))
if (!interactive()) dev.off()
{% endhighlight %}

# Results

At least on this problem, ``aspline()`` does a much better job than ``smooth.spline()``.
