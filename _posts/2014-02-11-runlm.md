# Introduction

As was expected, the ``runderiv()`` function has been both useful and deficient.  Useful because it offers a good replacement for ``smooth.spline()`` calculations of derivatives for things like N^2.  And deficient because it only calculated derivatives, not values!

Both an extension and a renaming were called for.  The result is ``runlm()``.

# Tests

Below are the examples from its manpage, with the results.

**Case 1**


{% highlight r linenos=table %}
library(oce)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Loading required package: methods Loading required package: mapproj
## Loading required package: maps
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r linenos=table %}
x <- 1:100
y <- 1 + x/100 + sin(x/5)
yn <- y + rnorm(100, sd = 0.1)
L <- 4
calc <- runlm(x, y, L = L, deriv = 0)
plot(x, y, type = "l", lwd = 7, col = "gray")
points(x, yn, pch = 20, col = "blue")
lines(x, calc, lwd = 2, col = "red")
{% endhighlight %}

**Case 2**

{% highlight r linenos=table %}
data(ctd)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(ctd, which = "N2")
{% endhighlight %}

![center]({{ site.url }}/assets/2014-02-11-runlm-case21.png) 

{% highlight r linenos=table %}
rho <- swRho(ctd)
z <- swZ(ctd)
zz <- seq(min(z), max(z), 0.1)
N2 <- -9.8/mean(rho) * runlm(z, rho, zz, deriv = 1)
lines(N2, -zz, col = "red")
legend("bottomright", lwd = 2, bg = "white", col = c("black", "red"), legend = c("swN2()", 
    "using runlm()"))
{% endhighlight %}

# Comments

1. The fit in Case 1 is almost spookily good.

2. The N^2 results suggest including this as a method for ``swN2()``, perhaps the default method, but that's for another day.
