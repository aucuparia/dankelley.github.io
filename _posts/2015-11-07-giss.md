# Introduction

I was watching a video of David Suzuki being interviewed on Australian TV, and
there were some questions about the "pause" in temperature in the GISS dataset.
I thought I'd like to check for myself, and reasoned that I may as well update
the ``giss`` dataset in the ``ocedata`` R package.

As always seems to be the case, the data format is changed a bit from autumn
2014, when I downloaded GISS and put it into ``ocedata``. So, I had to write
some new code, and thought it would make sense to plot the results, to check.

Along the way, I found a data file on my machine that I downloaded some time in
the past, but my tests tell me that it is not the one I used for ``ocedata``.
That means I have three datasets that I'd like to look at.

At the risk of providing fuel for debate about such things, I am presenting
code and graphs that show what I found. I make no claims to accurate
processing. For one thing, the only file for which I have a clear download
history is the one dated today.

# Procedure and results

First, I downloaded the latest dataset from
[NASA](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/updates_v3/), storing it in a file
named ``giss-2015-11-07.dat`` (available in a link given at the end of this
posting). Then I found another file, evidently from 2014, which I copied
locally and renamed ``giss-2014-xx-xx.dat`` (again, provided below). Note that
the file formats differ slightly, in the asterisks near the end; the new format
has spaces, which make it easier to read the data, whereas the old format is
clearly designed for fixed-width data readers.

Then I wrote code to read the new file. Then I plotted timeseries (left column)
and some differences (right column).

As you can see, my code is ugly and ad-hoc. Actually, it may contain errors,
and the main reason I'm posting this is to invite readers to email me if they
see any errors.

Pleae note that I have comments turned off because I don't have time to
moderate them, and unmoderated comments on a blog that might touch on climate
issues is a bit like dropping a lit match over a pool of gasoline and hoping
for the best.
