Octave does as follows, which looks pretty simple.  Since Octave is GPL, it seems perfectly reasonable to build R code based on this.

## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{y} =} filtfilt (@var{b}, @var{a}, @var{x})
##
## Forward and reverse filter the signal. This corrects for phase
## distortion introduced by a one-pass filter, though it does square the
## magnitude response in the process. That's the theory at least.  In
## practice the phase correction is not perfect, and magnitude response
## is distorted, particularly in the stop band.
##
## Example
## @example
## @group
## [b, a]=butter(3, 0.1);                  # 10 Hz low-pass filter
## t = 0:0.01:1.0;                         # 1 second sample
## x=sin(2*pi*t*2.3)+0.25*randn(size(t));  # 2.3 Hz sinusoid+noise
## y = filtfilt(b,a,x); z = filter(b,a,x); # apply filter
## plot(t,x,';data;',t,y,';filtfilt;',t,z,';filter;')
## @end group
## @end example
## @end deftypefn

## FIXME: My version seems to have similar quality to matlab,
##        but both are pretty bad.  They do remove gross lag errors, though.

    print_usage;

    ## Do forward and reverse filtering

    v = flipud(filter(b,a,flipud(v),si*v(end))); # reverse filter
    y(:,c) = v((lrefl+1):(lx+lrefl));
  endfor

# Comments

The two methods are not agreeing.  The test codes provided in the next section reveal that the problem is in the use of `filter`, which evidently gives different results in the two cases.  A problem is that the R version of ``stats::filter()`` is really not well documented, regarding ``init``, ``init.x`` and ``init.y``.  I am looking into this, but now that things are isolated to this level I have half a mind to just code the filter in C and hook it to oce, and thus to be independent of the ``signal`` package ... extreme, I know :-)
